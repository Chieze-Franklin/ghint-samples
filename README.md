## GitHint-Samples

This directory contains a list of conventions and how they are captured using GitHint.

To submit a new convention simply create a directory with a reasonable, URL-friendly name, and include in it the
following files:
* `.githint.json`: This is the GitHint representation of the conventions
* `README.md`: This contains necessary information regarding the conventions
